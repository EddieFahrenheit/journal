# Data engineering project idea

DAG RAG pipeline

## OpenAI Engineering

# Strong candidates may also have experience with:

-High performance, large-scale ML systems
-GPUs, Kubernetes, Pytorch, or OS internals
-Language modeling with transformers
-Reinforcement learning
-Large-scale ETL

# Representative projects:

-Optimizing the throughput of a new attention mechanism
-Comparing the compute efficiency of two Transformer variants
-Making a Wikipedia dataset in a format models can easily consume
-Scaling a distributed training job to thousands of GPUs
-Writing a design doc for fault tolerance strategies
-Creating an interactive visualization of attention between tokens in a language model

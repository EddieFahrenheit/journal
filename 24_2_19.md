# Today marks the day I begin documenting my thoughts and learning journey in markdown.

I've always avoided leetcode because I felt that it isn't the mark of a great engineer.
However I realize now that there are a few benefits to understanding data structure and algorithms.
In addition to being prepared for most interviews, you find DSA randomly sprinkled into daily computer science concepts.
In machine learning we come across

- Random Forest - Decision Trees
- Graph neural networks - Graphs
- Vectors/Matrixes - Arrays
- Top K values - Heaps

So I've decided to dedicate time to understanding at minimum these concepts in order:

1. Arrays
2. Decision Trees
3. Hashmaps
4. Graphs
5. Heaps
6. Dynamic Programming

# 11AM - Build LLM + RAG-powered chatbots (Slack, Discord)

- RAGAS is a framework to evaluate the quality of a RAG pipeline
- RAG is technically prompt engineering, as in it's extracting information from a separate source and injecting it straight into your prompt to the LLM
- RAG pipeline - Ingestion -> Retrieval -> Generation

### Ingestion

1. Documents get chunked (Typically separated by p or header tags, followed by a hard limit on character count)
2. Embedded into vector database via embedding models

- LLMS technically ALWAYS hallucinate- Their hallucinations typically align with your reality. When their hallucinations are technically false, then we label it hallucination.
- ZoomcampQABot involves Prefect, Pinecone, GPT_3_5, LangChain, Milvus
- Top K values must be reranked (Cohere Re-ranker) based on relevance

# 12PM CAMEL Meeting -

1. Building open source framework for multi-modal LLM to control and automate distributed systems, in preparation for expectations of GPT5 and benchmarking its capabilities
2. High expectations for multi-modal capabilities of GPT5
3. Define abstraction to easily evaluate tasks, such as opening a browser and sending a slack message
4. Specific user case - You are editing a video. You use your computer to first search a video from the internet. You upload the material to your video editor. You then need sequence of actions to use different softwares, perhaps with different expert agents. Different environments/virtual machines can be specified to handle different tasks.
5. One agent good at web search, one agent good at video editing.

Project 2-

Finetune specific model(LLAMA) to be very good at specific action calls

# Personal thoughts

1. Future project - Chatbot that listens to conversations, schedules events, creates polls for times, and refers you to previous conversations

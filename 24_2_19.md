# Today marks the day I begin documenting my thoughts and learning journey in markdown.

I've always avoided leetcode because I felt that it isn't the mark of a great engineer.
However I realize now that there are a few benefits to understanding data structure and algorithms.
In addition to being prepared for most interviews, you find DSA randomly sprinkled into daily computer science concepts.
In machine learning we come across

- Random Forest - Decision Trees
- Graph neural networks - Graphs
- Vectors/Matrixes - Arrays
- Top K values - Heaps

So I've decided to dedicate time to understanding at minimum these concepts in order:

1. Arrays
2. Decision Trees
3. Hashmaps
4. Graphs
5. Heaps
6. Dynamic Programming
